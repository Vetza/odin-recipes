My attempt at the Recipes project in TOP: Foundations

A basic HTML website that displays my top three favorite foods and links to pages that explain how to make them.
- Utilizes lists to display items in an effective manner
- All images have alt texts for user readability that indicate what the image contains
- Effective usage of paragraph and header tags to create a more visually appealing interface
- Ensured references to images in sub-directories effectively called on the appropriate parent directory

I learnt a lot about the absolute basics of what goes into an HTML boilerplate website, with an emphasis on
images, text, and links

This was also my first time effectively employing consistent usage of GIT and version control systems to ensure 
well documented code with useful commit messages for future reference
