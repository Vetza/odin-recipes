        While it may take forever to actually cook, lasagna tops any other pasta for that very reason. It can have as many layers as you want, drizzled with any sauces you want! I recommend you experiment with different meats, sauces and cooking methods when perfecting this dish. One thing is for certain though, it WILL taste AMAZING!
